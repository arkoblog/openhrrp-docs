..  4. Scale of execution
..  ######################

..  Given the sheer scale at which the survey was conducted (the project captured data for close to ~1.06MM buildings, ~5.77MM individuals), and the varying nature of the terrain in which it was carried out, its not unusual to expect a few variables with blank entries due to unexplained factors such as, but not limited to network disruption, device problems, server loads, etc.
    Missing values for some variables have been observed in the data, however it is important to note that:

..  1. The proportion of missing values is very low (~ less than 1%) for most columns that DO have missing values.
..  2. Important variables (in the context of damage assessment) such as Damage Grade, Status of the Damage, Building Structure etc. have no missing values.

..  However, if there are cases where the number of missing values are significantly high, investigation into why that may happen will be carried out in collaboration with CBS.
