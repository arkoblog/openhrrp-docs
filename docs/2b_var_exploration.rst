=============================
Variable exploration exercise
=============================

The variable exploration exercise is intended to help us identify how the data is going to be restructured for use in the open data portal. More specifically, this exercise will serve to:

    1. Identify naming conventions for variables across all 8 columns,
    2. Identify new variables that are not currently included, but can be extracted from the database.

Methodology
^^^^^^^^^^^

The exercise involves a thorough examination of each and every variable across all the 8 tables, keeping the following guidelines in mind:

Presence of null values
-----------------------
Are there null values (NAs) in the column? If yes, are they explainable? (maybe a branching question, that does not get asked to every respondent)

Presence of additional information
----------------------------------
Do some columns contain information that is better off if separated into a new column? For example, some damage assessment variables also contain information about no damage.

    i. If yes, how should this information be contained in the new column?
    ii. What would we name the column?

Representative Variable Name
----------------------------
Is the column name representative of the information contained within it? If not, what would be a better name for the column?


Summary and Findings
