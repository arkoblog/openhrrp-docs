Phase 1: Data Sense-making
##########################

The purpose of the sense-making exercise is to thoroughly examine the housing reconstruction data in order to:

    1. Understand the meaning of the data contained within each variable,
    2. Look for inconsistencies, such as, but not limited to:

        * Missing entries.
        * Outliers and unexpected values.
        * The presence of information other than what they are supposed to hold.

Furthermore, this exercise is also indented to help us identify how the data is going to be restructured for use in the open data portal. More specifically, the data sense-making exercise will help us:

    1. Identify naming conventions for variables across all 8 columns,
    2. Identify new variables that are not currently included, but can be extracted from the database.


The sense-making exercise has been carried out in the following two stages:
