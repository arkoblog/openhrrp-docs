Summary
-------

There seems to be only two additional columns apart from the keys (dist, vcode, vdcmun, ward, EA, howner_sn), they are:

	1. **name_sn**, which is a code.

		- Can this code be mapped to **mem_sn** column from the individual table? Not sure

	2. **gender**, which is categorical and can take the values 1,2,3.
