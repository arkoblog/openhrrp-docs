Reconciliation with data dictionary provided by the CBS
========================================================

In this initial exercise, definitions for variables in all the eight tables provided by the CBS `(click here to follow link) <https://arkoblog.github.io/nhrp-documentation/>`_ were compared against the data dictionary provided by the CBS. The purpose of this exercise was to:

    a. Identify unknown variables, for which definitions are not exactly clear.
    b. Get an understanding of how the variable was captured through the application: single-select vs. multi-select vs. text-entry
    c. Identify the format of the variable, which could be one of the following: (i) ID, (ii) Numeric, (iii) Categorical, (iv) Flag.

Please use the following links to go through detailed summaries that were prepared during the exercise for each of the eight tables.
