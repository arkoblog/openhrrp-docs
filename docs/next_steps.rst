Next Steps 
==========

The immediate next step involves the examination of individual columns keeping the following guidelines in mind:

1. Are there NAs in the column?
	
	a.If yes, are they explainable? (maybe a branching question, that does not get asked to every respondent) 

2. Do some columns contain information that is better off if seperated into a new column? For example, some damage assessment variables also contain information about no damage.

	a. If yes, how should this information be contained in the new column?
	b. What would we name the column?

3. Is the column name represantative of the information contained within it?

	a. If not, what would be a better name for the column?

4. If the variable is categorical, does the numeric coding start with 1?
	
	a. If not, should we start it with 1?  
	
Once the above exercise is complete, we will then proceed to the creation of an analytical dataset (ADS).
